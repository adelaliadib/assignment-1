Q1. Evaluating happiness after rolling out a company-wide salary increase.
Design of Study:
NR – O1 – X – O2

NR: Non-random sampling. Experiment will be done on one department in google. Non-random sampling amongst all departments will be perceived as unfair amongst colleagues and will skew the result, doing the experiment on the entire organization will be costly and keeps no control groups. In this case, our control are all the other departments

O1: Observation of performance and attrition rate prior to salary increase. I chose these two factors to represent happiness. They happier the employee the better they perform and the less they consider leaving their work.

X: rolling out a company-wide salary increase

O2: Observation of performance and attrition rate after the salary increase

Potential threats to inference:
There are few threats to the internal validity of the study 1. Selection. Respondents getting the salary increase in comparison to employees in other departments could confuse the results 2. Maturation. Naturally occurring changes in performance or attrition rate over time could be confused with the salary increase effect. Additionally, there are threats to the external validity:

Any national economic effect could reduce happiness of average employee
Any devastating world-wide events like pandemics could also affect the outcome
Q2. Managerial practice
Managerial tactics A and B could both be a better help for employee performance depending on the variables that cause employee happiness. There is an inferred causality that is not proven in the data. Experts could be right assuming the three conditions for causal inference are met.
